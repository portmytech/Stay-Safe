			"answer": "CHENNAI: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state rose to 571 with 86 new cases confirmed on Sunday. Of the 86, 85 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Delhi. The total number of positive cases linked to the Delhi meet is now 522. The state also reported two deaths, taking the number of deaths in TN to five. MeanwhileMeanwhile, a government order issued on April 4, said that the Tamil Nadu government is making fund allocations for the police department to enable it to enforce prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 till April 30. WhileWhile the earlier government order said that the prohibitory order is in force only till April 14, the new order suggests that the state government is mulling to extend it at least till April 30. However, it is expected that the list of restrictions under the prohibitory orders will vary after April 14 and a decision on this is expected in a few days. AA senior government official said that the new government order (issued on April 4) is only concerned about the police logistics. The order allocated funds to provide food till April 30 for police personnel involved in enforcement of the prohibitory orders as it is anticipated that the prohibitory orders will be extended. Speaking to reporters of the new cases, Health Secretary Dr Beela Rajesh said, Of the 571 cases, eight have been discharged, seven are undergoing treatment in private hospitals and the condition of seven patients is critical. Total 1,246 people who attended Delhi conference were traced so far. She added that samples were taken from 650 people with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and among them, four with contact history were positive. The State is still in Stage-2 of COVID-19 and has enough RT-PCR testing kits. The aim of the government is to set up testing facilities in all medical colleges in the State. An expert team constituted by the government is also studying how the virus has progressed in other countries. The team has also projected how the State would fare in a worst-case scenario. The government has also devised short-term and long-term plans, Dr Rajesh said. She said a population of 38,88,896 was covered under containment plan and 15,000 field workers were engaged in the task. 101 people quarantined. As many as 101 people, who attended the Ramnad funeral of the 70-year-old man, including the local MLA, had to be quarantined after his test result came back positive.",

			"answer": "NEW DELHI: This could just be initial days of COVID-19 outbreak in India but an analysis of cases in various states so far has thrown an interesting trend: the infection is not killing people uniformly across the country and there is a dramatic difference in the rate at which states are losing people to coronavirus. At 16.6, the percentage of people who have lost their life due to deadly coronavirus is highest in Himachal Pradesh followed by Gujarat which has seen nearly 9.5 per cent of all who got infected, dying. In contrast, in Rajasthan, which now has 200 confirmed cases, no death has been reported yet and in Tamil Nadu and Kerala two states with one of the highest identified cases the death rate due to COVID-19 is under 1. In Maharashtra, the state with the highest confirmed cases in the country the death rate due to COVID-19 is nearly 5 per cent. In Madhya Pradesh with 104 confirmed cases and 6 deaths the percentage of death too is well above 5. Globally, the death rate due to the infection has been estimated between 3 and 4 and it has been estimated that those above 60 and with co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and respiratory issues among others are much more susceptible to the infection. Males, it has been seen, are also slightly more likely to die of the infection, than females. Nationally, of total 3,374 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Sunday morning, 77 have died which marks a death rate of 2.2 per cent. Experts, while pointing out that more data is required to make sense of the fatality rate emerging so far underlined that some states could be testing more and treating better, showing a marked difference in the disease pattern. While heterogeneity in disease pattern across states is expected given the public health infrastructure in some states vis a vis others it can be fully analysed only if the government releases line-listed data which shows the age and health profile of patients, said Dr Anupam Singh, a public health researcher and infectious disease expert at Santosh Institute of Medical Sciences in Ghaziabad. Dr Anant Bhan, a researcher in bioethics and global health policy says that higher deaths in some states could be explained by the fact that they are only testing the symptomatic ones which report to hospitals with complications. Good to look at the age distribution of the tests in these states and see if there is a larger number. The other states might be testing more widely where you would pick up positives even among asymptomatic, or those with mild illnesses. Maharashtra is interestingly a bit of an outlier as a big state with comparatively better testing capacity, he said. Dr Oommen John, a researcher with the George Institute of Global Health echoed the views. Possibly very sick ones are the ones getting tested or at very serious stages, while those states who started testing liberally early have more people being tested, he said. It would be good to look at the age distribution of the tests in these states and see if there is a larger number.",

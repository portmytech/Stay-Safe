			"answer": "CHENNAI: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state rose to 571 with 86 new cases confirmed on Sunday. Of the 86, 85 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Delhi. The total number of positive cases linked to the Delhi meet is now 522. The state also reported two deaths, taking the number of deaths in TN to five. MeanwhileMeanwhile, a government order issued on April 4, said that the Tamil Nadu government is making fund allocations for the police department to enable it to enforce prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 till April 30. WhileWhile the earlier government order said that the prohibitory order is in force only till April 14, the new order suggests that the state government is mulling to extend it at least till April 30. However, it is expected that the list of restrictions under the prohibitory orders will vary after April 14 and a decision on this is expected in a few days. AA senior government official said that the new government order (issued on April 4) is only concerned about the police logistics. The order allocated funds to provide food till April 30 for police personnel involved in enforcement of the prohibitory orders as it is anticipated that the prohibitory orders will be extended. Speaking to reporters of the new cases, Health Secretary Dr Beela Rajesh said, Of the 571 cases, eight have been discharged, seven are undergoing treatment in private hospitals and the condition of seven patients is critical. Total 1,246 people who attended Delhi conference were traced so far. She added that samples were taken from 650 people with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and among them, four with contact history were positive. The State is still in Stage-2 of COVID-19 and has enough RT-PCR testing kits. The aim of the government is to set up testing facilities in all medical colleges in the State. An expert team constituted by the government is also studying how the virus has progressed in other countries. The team has also projected how the State would fare in a worst-case scenario. The government has also devised short-term and long-term plans, Dr Rajesh said. She said a population of 38,88,896 was covered under containment plan and 15,000 field workers were engaged in the task. 101 people quarantined. As many as 101 people, who attended the Ramnad funeral of the 70-year-old man, including the local MLA, had to be quarantined after his test result came back positive.",
